                    <strong>Step 1: Prospecting</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your charitable organization sets up its public profile it can get engagements from
                    Caviom visitors. In addition to this, when its link has been posted to social media platforms, it
                    can drive people to visit your public profile and increase its traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leads in this platform are the people who showed interest in your charitable organization by
                    viewing its public profile. They will be recognized and recorded as leads if they submit a form to
                    show your charitable organization their proof of donation or just to leave a message about their
                    interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Step 2: Qualifying Leads</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The records in your Leads must be filtered according to the criteria that your charitable
                    organization established based on its cultivation strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your charitable organization is looking for long-term benefactors; therefore, you must look
                        for consistent donors that your Charitable Organization thinks are best fit to provide
                        financial support in the long run.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Aside from recording the proof of donation for accounting purposes, if you think a Lead
                    is a potential volunteer or benefactor based on its message submitted - move and save their
                    contact information to the Prospects table.
